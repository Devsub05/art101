					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Making buttons is kind of hard. I'm still struggling to understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.</p>
					<ul>
					<li> I needed to look up videos and ask other friends to understand what I'm doing</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> This- the "problem" section or division for the make special button was not working so chatgpt told me to add $(document).ready() in my JS. I only used chatgpt for my problem section to work</li>
					<li> My Javascript wasn't showing up in my final live browser</li>
				</ul>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again. I also referred back to lecture slides and my section notes as much as I could. I did use chatgpt for the script output (not for extra credit, just for it to look neat)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section special">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 5 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. Again other classes are ramping up on work and I felt like I had to focus there than this assignment</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. The buttons are the Javascript. I worked the harderst for the javascript part! Overall, I would say 
						I'm kind of confused about libraries and Jquery but it made my website a whole lot more interesting!</p>
