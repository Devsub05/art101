					<p>Experiment with processing JSON from an API, with a partner</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab wasn't too hard. Looking back at the notes was what helped me the most</p>
					<ul>
					<li>I did use chatgpt to help me debug cause it kept saying error. I also fixed this using console log</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times. But honestly I just re-read it and I found the mistakes</li>
					<li> Everything should be working correctly</li>
					<li> Class work helped but I would say this lab was really complicated</li>
				</ul>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube to comprehend everything. Asking my friends helped me the most.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 4-6 hours on this assignemnt and it was hard but doable. The example in the lab helped me A LOT.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the script output. Everything should be working. It should update whenever XKCD posts a new comic</p>
					<div id="output" class="output"></div>
					<button id="activate">Click me</button>
