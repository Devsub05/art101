			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Object</h1>
			<img class="transportation" src="../lab6/img/Transportation.webp" >
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We had to experiment Javascript arrays and objects with a partner</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Javascript is it's own language and getting used to some of the coding is kind of hard. I also had trouble linking everything together again.</p>
					<li> My html and css were not syncing</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> Parts of my website was not linking properly live</li>
					<li> My Javascript wasn't showing up in my final live browser</li>
					<p>Since they were really minor problems I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 4 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. I started late because I had so many other assignments due this week </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. The next section will have the javascript. I worked the harderst for this part! Overall, I would say 
						I'm starting understanding arrays and objects have been hard for me so I do hope to improve on those later on.
