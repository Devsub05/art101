			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning to think in terms of pseudocoding before coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wanted to change a lot of the CSS in this part but I found that a little time consuming </p>
					<li> My html and css were not syncing</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> Parts of my website was not linking properly live</li>
					<li> I forgot how to play pictionary and had to do some research for that</li>
					<p>Since they were really specific problems I not only tried to watch tutorials on youtube but I also used chatgpt for help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 6 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made.
						What was hard about this is that I didn't know why the CSS was affecting my html
						I also definetly needed the help of Chatgpt to figure our why parts of my final website wasn't working.
						I also figured out how to link back to my hompage.
				        I could have started earlier, I just had a lot of work ramping up this week </p>
					<p> I had the help of AI to code the css component. </p>

            		<h5> Task 2: Pseudocode for a Simple Computer Game</h5>
					<h6>Game: Pictionary</h6>
					<img class="Pictionary" src="../lab4/img/Pictionary.jpg" >
<pre>
Task: Build a digital version of Pictionary where players draw and guess words.
						
	1. Start a Game
		- Start up game screen
		- Project Title and Instructions of the game
		- Wait for players to join or start
						
	2. Set Up the Game
		- Gather a certain number of players (your choice)
		- Assign names to each of the players
		- Determine the drawing order in a randomized fashion to pick a drawer
						
	3. Start a Game Loop
	 - Repeat until the winning condition is met:
		 - Select a word for the drawer randomly
		 - The word should be hidden from the guessers
						
	4. Drawing Time
		- Display a drawing canvas to the drawer
		- Enable basic drawing tools (pen,erase,clear,color)
		- Start a timer to make the game more challenging
						
	5. Guessing Time (runs during drawing time)
		- Guessers can guess through chat or text box
		- System checks if each guess matches the word
		- If a guesser guesses correctly:
				- End round
				- Distribute points to guesser and drawer
						
	6. End of Round (once everyone guesses)
		- Show correct word (if no one guesses)
		- Update the scoreboard
		- Move to next player in the correct turn order
						
	7. End Game
		- After a set number of rounds: (3)
		- Display final scores
		- Announce the winner
		- Offer option to play again or exit
