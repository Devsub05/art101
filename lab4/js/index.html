                    <h5> Task 2: Pseudocode for a Simple Computer Game</h5>
					<h6>Game: Pictionary</h6>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<pre>
						High-Level Goal: Build a digital version of Pictionary where players draw and guess words.
						
						1. Start a Game
						   - Start up game screen
						   - Project Title and Instructions of the game
						   - Wait for players to join or start
						
						2. Set Up the Game
						   - Gather a certain number of players (your choice)
						   - Assign names to each player
						   - Randomly determine the drawing order
						
						3. Begin Game Loop
						   - Repeat for every round or until the winning condition is met:
							 - Randomly determine to draw on a player
							 - Select a word for the drawer randomly
							 - The word should be hidden from the guessers
						
						4. Drawing Phase
						   - Display a drawing canvas to the drawer
						   - Enable basic drawing tools (pen, color, erase, clear)
						   - Start a timer to make the game more challenging
						
						5. Guessing Phase (runs during drawing)
						   - Guessers can input guesses via chat or text box
						   - System checks if each guess matches the word
						   - If a guesser guesses correctly:
							 - End round
							 - Distribute points to guesser and drawer
						
						6. End of Round
						   - Show correct word (if no one guesses)
						   - Update the scoreboard
						   - Move to next player in the correct turn order
						
						7. End Game
						   - After a set number of rounds:
							 - Display final scores
							 - Announce the winner
							 - Offer option to play again or exit
