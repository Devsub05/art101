					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 6 hours on this assignment trying to figure out if I made any mistakes.
				       I could have started earlier, I just had a lot of work ramping up this week </p>
					<p> I had the help of AI to code. </p>

            		<h5> Task 2: Pseudocode for a Simple Computer Game</h5>
					<h6>Game: Pictionary</h6>
<pre>
High-Level Goal: Build a digital version of Pictionary where players draw and guess words.
						
	1. Start a Game
		- Start up game screen
		- Project Title and Instructions of the game
		- Wait for players to join or start
						
	2. Set Up the Game
		- Gather a certain number of players (your choice)
		- Assign names to each player
		- Randomly determine the drawing order
						
	3. Begin Game Loop
	 - Repeat for every round or until the winning condition is met:
		 - Randomly determine to draw on a player
		 - Select a word for the drawer randomly
		 - The word should be hidden from the guessers
						
	4. Drawing Phase
		- Display a drawing canvas to the drawer
		- Enable basic drawing tools (pen, color, erase, clear)
		- Start a timer to make the game more challenging
						
	5. Guessing Phase (runs during drawing)
		- Guessers can input guesses via chat or text box
		- System checks if each guess matches the word
		- If a guesser guesses correctly:
				- End round
				- Distribute points to guesser and drawer
						
	6. End of Round
		- Show correct word (if no one guesses)
		- Update the scoreboard
		- Move to next player in the correct turn order
						
	7. End Game
		- After a set number of rounds:
		- Display final scores
		- Announce the winner
		- Offer option to play again or exit
