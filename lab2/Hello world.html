            <h1> <strong>Hello World</strong> </h1>
            <p> My name is Devika and I am an agpm major. 
            I have a twin sister that goes to UIUC and I love doing anything related to art. 
            I love singing and I am a first degree black belt in mixed martial arts. 
            This year I want to get out and read more. This coding class excites me because I know nothing about it.
             Like as we speak I'm literally just using the most basic knowledge I have of coding. I met my partner during section. 
            Here are few fact about her. </p>
