			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We are supposed to make a basic HTML and CSS style file with our partner. Then we view it in our browser and inspect it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems we faced was that my partner's HTML file wasn't working properly. We then had to make sure it was as close to the template file we were given. Another problem that arose for me was CSS. If everything wasn't typed out properly, the visual aspect that I want to change doesn't work. Luckily I was able to overcome the challenge after I made sure I typed out everything correctly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I liked that my partner and I were able to help each other in the lab. We went over our struggles and tried to make sure we were on the same page. We also worked together in person early on, so that if any problems arose we could fix it. Overall, the one thing I would change is trying to be more involved in helping my partners, but since I am quite new to the vocabulary and programs I'm having a little trouble communicating those issues. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Both of our efforts are shown well through our files. We both worked very hard to get the code right</p>
