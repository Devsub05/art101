					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Create a function that depends on conditionals with a partner.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This is definetly the harderst lab for me. My JS was just not working. I had to wrap my text ($(document).ready) for it to work again</p>
					<ul>
					<li>My sister (who has taken a coding class before) told me to "label for="input" tags instead of "paragraph" tags to make my life a little easier in the script output section</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times. I debugged this with console log.</li>
					<li> Making the js show up was the hardest part and I also had to change part of my javascript away from the example. I had to do (result.class and result.text instead of the str thing. I did get help from chatgpt for this part cause no one I asked could help me.)</li>
					<li> I had to debug this multiple times through console.log</li>
				</ul>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again. I also referred back to lecture slides and my section notes as much as I could, plus the assignment itself (that helped me the most). I used chatgpt to understand why my javascript was working. I honestly think I might have went more than my skill level which is why this lab was so difficult for me</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 9 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made plus trying to figure out what I'm doing in the first place. Referring to Wes modes' website and console log helped me a lot in this process. I will say I had a lot of help from chatgpt in this assignement. I'm not understanding conditionals the best. The codes I used from chatgpt were mentioned above. Section notes helped but lecture notes did not.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. I think I will be struggling to balance other classes with this class through the rest of the quarter to be honest</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. You will see my javascript in the script output section. I worked the harderst for the javascript part! I'm starting to understand and get fluent with Javascript (with a few hurdles ofc!). Conditionals are tough, but I think I'm starting to have a basic understanding of it. I hope to get better later, but I hope this lab works out fine!</p>
