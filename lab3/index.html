			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to server with a partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We couldn't figure out how to publish our files into the server. We solved it by going to youtube and figuring how to publish the files </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We did the best we could in the time we were given for this assignment. I probably could have written a bigger paragraph but publishing the website seemed more important with the time limit we had. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Our efforts are shown by what we have created with the lab assigment. I would say we gave what the lab is looking for.  </p>
