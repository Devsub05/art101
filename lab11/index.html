					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Experiment with JS events with a partner.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Making buttons is kind of hard. This lab was easier because it felt familiar to what we did in class</p>
					<ul>
					<li> I needed to look up videos and ask other friends to understand what I'm doing. Referring back to the notes and the actual lab instructions helped a lot. This was my main support for this lab</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times. I debugged this with console log.</li>
					<li> One exciting thing that I did later was animation. This was really hard because I didn't put the '`' symbol and it wasn't working for me. Also the structure really threw me off. But luckily one of my family members helped me out with this. Now it looks super cool!</li>
					<li> I had to debug this multiple times</li>
				</ul>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again. I also referred back to lecture slides and my section notes as much as I could, plus the assignment itself (that helped me the most). I used chatgpt to understand what i'm doing and also help me with the animation part when it wasn't working</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 5 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made plus trying to figure out what I'm doing in the first place. Referring to Wes modes' website and console log helped me a lot in this process.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. I still am struggling to balance other classes with this class</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. You will see my javascript in the script output section. I worked the harderst for the javascript part! I'm starting to understand and get fluent with Javascript (with a few hurdles ofc!)</p>
