			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<img class="car" src="../lab5/img/IMG_6085.jpg" >
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We had to experiment with basic javascript data types and variables with a partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had to change the CSS according to the lab which was challening</p>
					<li> My html and css were not syncing</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> Parts of my website was not linking properly live</li>
					<li> My Javascript wasn't showing up in my final live browser</li>
					<p>Since they were really minor problems I tried to watch tutorials on youtube.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 4 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made.
						What was hard about this is that I didn't know to link my javascript into my html while also preserving my css. 
						Almost everything else in this assignment was pretty easy to do </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the javascript. I worked the harderst for this part! Overall, I would say 
						I'm starting to understand the nature of javascript, but I do think it takes a lot longer than
						other coding we've done. The link right below this one is the link for lab 5 index.html
