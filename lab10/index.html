					<p> Experiment with DOM manipulation with a partner.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Making buttons is kind of hard. But blending css, html, and javascript has been ridicously difficult. Below I will mentioned how I solved my problems</p>
					<ul>
					<li> I needed to look up videos and ask other friends to understand what I'm doing. This was my main support for this lab</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> Everything was working, but making the CSS was really confusing for me. I used the example and what I learned in section to help with this. I also used chatgpt to add the nth part to make it seem like text messages </li>
					<li> My Javascript wasn't showing up in my final live browser</li>
				</ul>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again. I also referred back to lecture slides and my section notes as much as I could, plus the assignment itself (that helped me the most). I used chatgpt to understand what i'm doing but nothing too crazy</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 8 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made plus trying to figure out what I'm doing in the first place. Referring to Wes modes' website helped me a lot in this process.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. I feel like I'm a little lost at the moment, but I don't even have time to focus in this class because I'm trying to balance other classes at the same time</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. You will see my javascript in the script output section. I worked the harderst for the javascript part! Overall, I would say 
						I'm a little lost, but I got everything to work- so hopefully I'm understanding everything correctly!</p>
