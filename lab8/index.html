			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with Anonymous functions and callbacks with a partner</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Javascript is it's own language and getting used to some of the coding is kind of hard. I'm still struggling to understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.</p>
					<li> I needed to look up videos and ask other friends to understand what I'm doing</li>
					<li> I messed up the Javascript a few times</li>
					<li> My final website needed tweeking</li>
					<li> My Javascript wasn't showing up in my final live browser</li>
					<p>I tried to watch tutorials on youtube again. I also referred back to lecture slides and my section notes as much as I could. I did use chatgpt for the script output (not for extra credit, just for it to look neat)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably worked for about 3-4 hours on this assignment trying to figure out what mistakes I made.
					 	The main thing I could have worked on is time management. I started on time but this lab was still kind of confusing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below for the html page. The next section will have the javascript. I worked the harderst for the javascript part! Overall, I would say 
						I'm starting understanding functions and also starting to understand it's purpose (tho it's real tricky!)
